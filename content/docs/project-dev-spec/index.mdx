# Product Project Development Workflow

Created by Jiang Yan, last modified on Oct 18, 2023

This product development workflow is based on the **Agile Scrum methodology**.

---

## 🧰 Tools

First and foremost, a **task management tool** is needed to track and manage all tasks. Common tools include:

- ZenTao (禅道)
- Jira
- GitHub Projects

> We use **ZenTao** as our main tool for product and project management.

---

## 🔁 Development Process (Based on Scrum)

Product and project tasks are broken down and executed in **Sprints** (iterations). Each Sprint is a focused development cycle with clear goals.

---

### 1. 🗓 Sprint Planning

- **Term:** `Product Backlog` (Requirement Pool)
- Before each new Sprint starts, the Product Manager must ensure the backlog contains at least **two weeks’ worth of tasks**.

---

### 2. 🧾 Sprint Meeting (Task & Requirement Clarification)

Deliverables before Sprint begins:

- Requirement document
- Prototype design
- Decompose features into tasks in ZenTao
- Define **task priority**

> 🛠 Product and project staff should finalize these items before the Sprint begins, enabling developers to start effectively.

---

### 3. 🧱 Technical Standards Review

Before the **first Sprint**, the development team should confirm and enforce **product technical architecture standards** according to the roles below.

| Area                | Responsible Person(s) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Frontend Architecture | Qiu Lihua |
| Backend Architecture  | Zhang Lele, Chen Yudong, Mo Jianlan, Fu Zhangbing — Backends follow standards per product |
| UI Design & Interaction | Product Owner (Chen Ran, Xie Labing) — If the vendor has their own UI standards, follow those |
| Testing | Wang Fengying — Ensure all technical standards are checked and confirmed via checklist |

> 📋 Refer to the “Product Technical Standards” document for detailed items.

---

### 4. 💻 Development & Testing

Once the Sprint starts, developers begin implementing high-priority `TODO` tasks from ZenTao, following priority order.

> Standard dev & test processes apply here — not repeated.

---

### 5. 🚀 Release

#### Release Participants:

- **Developers (Dev: frontend & backend)**  
  Ensure functional implementation is correct.

- **QA (Testers)**  
  Validate the interface functionality, flow, and data correctness.

- **Product / Project Manager**  
  Confirm success (or failure/rollback) from a **user’s perspective**.

- **Release Manager**  
  Execute the release and ensure successful deployment.

---

### 6. 🤝 Daily Standup Meetings

Optional — based on team needs.

- Short daily meetings to share:
  - What was done yesterday
  - What will be done today
  - Any blockers or issues

> Helps surface problems early instead of discovering them at the last minute.

---

## 📌 Summary & Reflection

Scrum isn't mandatory, but this kind of workflow is **fundamental and necessary**:

- ✅ Every version must have a **clear release plan** with listed tasks
- ✅ Developers and testers must know **task details**
- ✅ Track task status clearly from `TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE`
- ✅ Communicate **regularly and frequently** to surface problems early
- ✅ Conduct **post-mortems** to reflect and improve

---

## 🔍 Before Starting a New Product or Delivery

Every product, project, and dev lead should ask themselves:

- Have we used a **task management tool** to organize all tasks?
- Is there a **clear plan** that everyone understands?
- Do the responsible people **fully understand the task details**?
- Are there **any blockers** when completing the tasks?
