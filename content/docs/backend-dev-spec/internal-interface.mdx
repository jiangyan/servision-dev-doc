# Frontend-Backend API Specification (2022 Edition)

Created by Zhang Lele, last modified on Oct 26, 2023

## 📌 Current Issues

- Not compatible with Swagger for auto-generating useful docs, especially for **query interfaces**, which lack clarity on `args` fields and require manual filling.
- **Encoding/decoding** of query interface definitions makes **reuse and cross-service invocation difficult**.
- **Not suitable for exposing directly to third-party clients**.
- Previously, only **query APIs** were defined. **Create/Update/Delete** operations lack standardized definitions.
- No **unified error code system** for inter-service error tracing, making debugging time-consuming.
- Lacks **built-in parameter validation** mechanisms.
- **No ongoing maintenance** of the spec — this needs active follow-up.

---

## 🌐 General API Principles

- Under the premise of convenience and consistency, strive to be **as RESTful as possible**.

---

## 🔍 Query API Patterns

### ✅ Simple Query

```
GET /parts/{id}
```

### ✅ Complex Query

Example:

```
GET /parts?partCode=P01&partName=发动机&page=1&pageSize=20&ordering=partCode,-partName
```

#### Explanation:

| Type             | Example                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Equality         | `partCode=P01`                            |
| Range            | `partCode_lt=20`, `partCode_gt=10`        |
| Date             | `createdDate=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` or timestamp |
| Fuzzy Search     | `keyword=xxx`                             |
| Multi-value      | `partCode=P01,P02`                        |
| Single-value     | `partCode=P01`                            |

> 🚧 Note: Though it gives control to the frontend, filtering logic can stay on the backend for simplicity.

#### Pagination:

- `page`: requested page number (default: `1`)
- `pageSize`: number of items per page (default: `20`)

#### Sorting:

- `ordering`: fields to sort by, e.g. `partCode`, `-partName` (prefix `-` for descending)

> For report-like queries, frontend can control filtering. If backend performance is affected, consider moving fixed reports to a dedicated **report module**.

> For overly long `GET` URLs, switch to `POST` to avoid issues like NGINX interception and to improve cacheability. (**TODO**)

## 📦 Response Structure

### ✅ Common Fields

- `code`: Business-level status code  
  - Examples:
    - `H200`: Success
    - `B50001`: Backend business error
    - `C100`: Frontend parsing error

- `message`:  
  - Should always be **user-friendly and display-ready**.
  - Internally, errors should be mapped from a table with developer messages + user messages.

| Code     | Dev Message                    | User Message                          | Trace |
|----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| B50001   | Failed to get part number (Redis down) | Part creation failed, contact admin | xxx    |
| B50002   | Failed to create part (DB down)        | Part creation failed, contact admin | xxxx   |

### ✅ HTTP Status Mapping

- Success: `200`
- Authentication failed: `401`
- Authorization failed: `403`
- Business logic error: `599`

### 🧾 Paged Response

```json
{
  "code": "",
  "message": null,
  "total": 2000,
  "list": [
    { "code": "p10", "partName": "发动机" },
    { "code": "p10", "partName": "发动机" }
  ]
}
```

### 📄 Non-Paged Response

```json
{
  "code": "",
  "message": null,
  "list": [
    { "code": "p10", "partName": "发动机" },
    { "code": "p10", "partName": "发动机" }
  ]
}
```

### ❌ Error Response

```json
{
  "code": "B50001",
  "message": "服务器忙，请稍后重试",
  "list": []
}
```

### 🚫 Unauthorized Response

```http
HTTP_STATUS = 403
```

```json
{
  "code": "H403",
  "message": "无此权限",
  "list": []
}
```

---

## ✍️ Create / Edit / Delete Operations

All create/update/delete should be **`POST`** requests.

### ➕ Create

```http
POST /parts
```

```json
{
  "partCode": "P01",
  "partName": "发动机"
}
```

### ✏️ Edit (Full Update)

```http
POST /parts/{id}
```

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "partCode": "P01",
  "partName": "发动机"
}
```

### ❌ Delete (Batch or Single)

```http
POST /parts/delete
```

```json
["id1", "id2", "id3"]
```

> Using RESTful paths like `/parts` + method is preferred over `/parts/create` or `/parts/add`, which vary by developer habits. Now that **authorization is bound to URI + method**, a RESTful structure brings consistency.

## 📤 Export

### Request:

```http
GET /parts/export?partCode=P01&partName=发动机&page=1&pageSize=20&ordering=partCode,-partName&field=a,b,c
```

- Frontend must **specify which fields to export**
- Consider integrating this into a **report center**

### Response:

- Do **not** return file stream directly
- Return a downloadable `res` link
- Frontend handles the file download

## 🌍 GraphQL (For Consumer-Facing Apps)

For C-end applications like mobile apps, **GraphQL** is more suitable for aggregating data from multiple services.  
Standard for GraphQL-based APIs is **TBD**.
