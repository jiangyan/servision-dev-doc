# API Version Management Plan

Created by webmaster, last modified by Zhang Lele on Oct 31, 2024

This document outlines the main approaches for managing API versions in production systems.

---

## 📌 Common Versioning Methods

| Method | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Path-based versioning** (Recommended) | `www.example.com/v1/api/example` | Most commonly used and versioned explicitly in the URL |
| **Query parameter versioning** | `api.example.com/api?version=v1&...` | **Not recommended** — less visible and harder to cache |
| **Header-based versioning** | Custom header: `X-API-VERSION: v1` | Easy to implement; requires client to set headers correctly |
| **Subdomain-based versioning** | `v1.api.example.com` | Useful for long-term multi-version coexistence via separate deployments |

## ☕ Java Spring-Based Implementation

### ✅ 1. **Path-Based Versioning** (Recommended)

- Version info is embedded directly into the URL path, such as:

```
www.example.com/v1/api/example
```

- Suggested for clarity and compatibility with documentation tools like Swagger.

- Reference: [API versioning strategy (by HiFreud)](https://www.hifreud.com/2018/01/30/01-API-versioning/)

### ⚠️ 2. **Query Parameter Versioning**

```
api.example.com/api?version=v1&...
```

- **Not recommended**
- Less readable, less cacheable, more error-prone in complex scenarios

---

### 🔧 3. **Header-Based Versioning**

- Simple to implement
- Used in previous mobile app projects
- Requires clients (e.g., app) to set headers properly

#### Spring Example:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/search", headers = "X-API-VERSION=v1")
public class SearchController extends BaseDataController {
   ...
}
```

> 🔍 Pros: Easy to implement  
> ⚠️ Cons: Less visible and less flexible than path-based versioning

### 🗂️ 4. **Subdomain-Based Versioning**

- Example: `v1.api.example.com`
- Each version is deployed independently, suitable for **multi-version long-term maintenance**
- Requires **separate codebases or branches**
- Most suitable when version count is low and isolated maintenance is preferred

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Limit the number of coexisting API versions**
  - Too many versions increase maintenance cost and complexity
  - Encourage clients to upgrade to newer versions where possible
