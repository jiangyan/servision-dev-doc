# Micro Frontend Framework

## Introduction

Micro Frontend is a frontend architectural pattern that allows breaking down a frontend application into independent, smaller applications that can be developed and deployed separately. This pattern borrows ideas from microservices and applies them to frontend development.

- [Zhihu Article: Introduction to Micro Frontends](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/78362028)

## Core Concepts

- **Independent Deployment**: Each micro frontend can be built and deployed independently
- **Technology Stack Independence**: Teams can choose their preferred technology stack
- **Team Autonomy**: Promotes independent development between teams
- **Consistent User Experience**: The product should appear as a unified whole to end users

## Common Implementation Approaches

1. **Route-based Distribution**
2. **iframe Integration**
3. **Web Components**
4. **JavaScript Integration**
5. **Build-time Integration**

## Advantages

- Teams can develop and deploy independently
- Smaller codebases that are easier to maintain
- Progressive upgrading of legacy systems
- Flexible technology stack choices

## Challenges

- Maintaining consistent user experience
- Performance optimization
- Inter-module communication
- Shared dependency management

## Popular Frameworks

- Single-SPA
- qiankun
- Module Federation
- Luigi
- Piral
